# Express server for notifications
### Problem:
On my [personal page](https://github.com/NickZemlin/NZportfolio-page) i have a contact form, but i didnt want to get that information via email or [Netlify forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)
### Solution:
Express.js server that can recieve POST requests from my [personal page](https://github.com/NickZemlin/NZportfolio-page)  and forward them to a telegram bot, that would send me a message.
